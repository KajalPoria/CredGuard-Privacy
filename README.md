**CREDGUARD — Redefining trust in global finance.**

### **Privacy-Preserving Global Credit Verification Platform**

**CREDGUARD** is a **privacy-first, global credit trust infrastructure** that enables individuals to access fair credit across borders **without exposing raw financial data**.
It solves the problem of **cross-border credit invisibility** using **encrypted behavioral intelligence, AI, and secure vector search powered by CyborgDB**.

> **Your Credit. Encrypted. Global. Yours.**

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Millions of migrants, international students, remote workers, and expatriates are denied loans because:

* Credit history is locked within national borders
* Banks cannot verify foreign credit records
* Privacy laws prevent data sharing

Traditional systems fail to balance **trust, privacy, and global interoperability**.

---

## 💡 Solution

CREDGUARD creates a **global, privacy-preserving credit identity** using:

* **Encrypted Behavioral Identity (EBI)**
* **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
* **AI behavioral embeddings**
* **CyborgDB encrypted vector search**

Banks assess risk **without ever accessing raw financial data**.

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🔐 Encrypted Behavioral Identity (EBI)

* Converts behavioral metrics (repayment, stability, income consistency) into an **irreversible encrypted vector**
* No bank statements, transactions, or personal identifiers shared
* Portable across countries

---

### 🌐 Global Trust Fabric (Powered by CyborgDB)

* Secure similarity matching of encrypted vectors
* Sub-second credit verification
* Scalable for millions of users and institutions

---

### 🧮 Privacy-Preserving Inference

* Uses **Homomorphic Encryption** and **SMPC**
* Banks receive only:

  * Trust score
  * Risk signal
  * Fraud indicator
* No data decryption possible

---

### ⚖️ AI Fairness & Compliance Layer

* Removes bias related to nationality, migration status, income, and geography
* Complies with:

  * GDPR
  * EU AI Act
  * CCPA
  * PDPA
  * RBI norms

---

### 🔍 Fraud Detection (Encrypted)

* Detects synthetic identities and repeated default patterns
* Works entirely on encrypted vectors
* No deanonymization

---

### 🧾 Zero-Knowledge Regulatory Explainability (ZK-REX)

* Regulators can verify *why* a decision was made
* Cryptographic proofs without exposing user data

---

## 🖥️ User Dashboard

### Pages Included

* **Encrypted Credit Identity**
* **Verification History**
* **Consent Management**
* **Connected Institutions**
* **Fraud & Trust Analytics**

### Interactive Elements

* Clickable trust score
* Clickable verification records
* Connected banks with **Import Behavioral Metrics**
* Encrypted vector visualization
* Loading indicators during CyborgDB processing

---

## 🏦 Bank / Institution Functionality

Banks can:

* Request loan verification using EBI
* Ask user for **loan amount**
* Receive:

  * Eligibility status
  * Risk confidence score
  * Fraud likelihood
* Never see raw data

All access is:

* Consent-based
* Auditable
* Regulation-compliant

---

## 🔄 Loan Application Flow

1. User connects a bank
2. Bank requests:

   * Loan amount needed
3. User applies using encrypted identity
4. CyborgDB performs secure vector similarity search
5. Bank receives decision signal

---

## 🔑 Authentication & Security

* Clean **/auth** page (Sign up / Login)
* Email validation
* Protected dashboard routes
* Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

* **profiles**
* **encrypted_identities**
* **verifications**
* **consents**
* **institutions**

All sensitive fields are encrypted and access-controlled.

---

## ⚙️ CyborgDB Integration
